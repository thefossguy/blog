Hi! I am a developer but write Linux and FOSS related articles at the moment. I write on [It's FOSS](https://itsfoss.com/author/pratham/), [Linux Handbook](https://linuxhandbook.com/author/pratham/) and [Learn Ubuntu](https://learnubuntu.com/author/pratham/).

My git profiles:

 - [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/thefossguy)
 - [GitHub](https://github.com/thefossguy)
 - [-rc](https://git.thefossguy.com/thefossguy/) (my gitea server; changes are sent here before GitHub and GitLab)
