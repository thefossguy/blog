## Why Neovim?

My main purpose of using Neovim is that it has LSB built in (`:help lsp`). You may have your own reasons. If you don't, Google it.

## Adding Plugins

To add some IDE-like functionalities to Neovim, you need to add some plugins first. If you do not know how to add plugins to Neovim, refer to my tutorial at [Linux Handbook.com]() to get more clarity.
